## Technology Stack

- **React 19** - Modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** - Next-generation frontend build tool (blazing fast!)
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with gradients, animations, and flexbox/grid

## Deploying to Github Pages
### Prerequisites

- You must have a GitHub account and push your code to a GitHub repository.
- Ensure your `package.json` has a `"homepage"` field set to `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.
- Install the `gh-pages` package as a dev dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

### Update `package.json` Scripts

Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
   "predeploy": "npm run build",
   "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

### Configure Vite for GitHub Pages

In your `vite.config.js`, set the `base` option to your repo name:
```js
export default defineConfig({
   base: '/<your-repo>/',
   // ...other config
});
```

### Manual Deployment

To deploy manually, run:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Deploy Automatically with GitHub Actions

Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
   push:
      branches:
         - main

jobs:
   deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
            with:
               node-version: 18
         - run: npm ci
         - run: npm run build
         - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
            with:
               github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
               publish_dir: ./dist
```

After pushing to `main`, your site will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Pages**.
2. Set the source branch to `gh-pages` and the folder to `/ (root)`.

Your app will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.
